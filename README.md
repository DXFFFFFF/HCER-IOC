# HCER-IOC
Our handwritten chemical equations dataset is divided into two parts: inorganic and organic.
To further increase the dataset size for network training, we augmented the dataset to 11,839 samples by applying random rotations (-15° to 15°) and adding random noise. We refer to this dataset as HCED-IOC.
