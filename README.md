# HCER-IOC
Our handwritten chemical equations dataset is divided into two parts: inorganic and organic.
First, we selected 664 commonly used inorganic chemical and ionic equations, as well as 60 organic chemical equations. We then invited several volunteers to randomly write different chemical equations using a stylus on a tablet canvas, collecting a total of 1,520 samples.
Then, we downloaded 2,200 images of student-uploaded homework from educational websites, which contained multiple chemical equations. From these images, we segmented individual chemical equations.
To further increase the dataset size for network training, we augmented the dataset to 11,839 samples by applying random rotations (-15° to 15°) and adding random noise. We refer to this dataset as HCED-IOC.
